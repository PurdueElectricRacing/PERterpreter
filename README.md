# Purpose
The purpose of this was initially to serve as a CLI extension for a graphical frontend which had additional functionality. The ultimate goal of the graphical front end was to serve as a way to perform various simulation modes for the car so we could perform manual testing as well as scripted testing. However, as this project developed it was decided that this system could serve most of the purposes of the GUI tool, and thus the gooey tool was phased out and never implemented. Additionally, it seems unlikely that accurate simulation models could be achieved given our limited (mine specifically) availability and time to fully understand all of the possible operation modes for the motor controller. A BMS simulator could be done, though it seems tedious, and like a project in and of itself. 

Anyway, PERterpreter is now the official scripting language of PER, which should allow us to perform automated testing of simplistic functionality (GPIO, CAN messaging, and serial communication).

It allows for creating of test scripts which output PASSED or FAILED, depending on the results of any `assert` functions in the code. 

TODO explain this shizz better yo. Basically what I mean by this is i need to break down the code location a lot better and document how stuff intermingles (because it's all spaghetti) also talk about the PERS highlighter
# Cloning this repo
To clone this repository, run the following command as this project makes use of git submodules.

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/PurdueElectricRacing/PERterpreter.git`


Running the interpreter
========================
The executable is supposed to be built into the `./build` directory. You can run it from here by passing the arguments necessary (see [commands](#perterpreter-commands)), or you can add it to your path.

### Special considerations for Windows


## Language Grammar

The following grammar is given in EBNF for the sake of easier understanding.
`*` is used to denote 0 or more instances of the preceding token.
`|` is used to denote or, for example if something can take a literal string OR a variable name as argument, it would be expressed as `string_literal|Identifier`



`testScript: VariableAssignment* RoutineDeclaration* TestDeclaration*`
`RoutineDeclaration: routine string_literal '{' Statement* '}'`
`TestDeclaration: test string_literal '{' Statement* '}'`

```
Statement:
  if ( Exp ) { Statement * }
  | if ( Exp ) { Statement * } else { Statement * }
  | VariableAssignment
  | call string_literal ;
  | loop Exp|forever { Statement* }
  | set-pin DOUT intLiteral|Identifier HIGH|LOW
  | set-pin AOUT intLiteral|Identifier intLiteral|Identifier
  | read-pin AIN|DIN intLiteral|Identifier
  | expect Exp ;
  | assert Exp ;
  | perrint Exp ;
  | print Exp ;
  | println Exp ;
  | perrintln Exp ;
  | send-msg hexLiteral|Identifier Exp ;
  | read-msg hexLiteral|Identifier ;
  | delay Exp ;
  | prompt string_literal ;
  | serial-tx Exp ;
  | serial-rx ;
  | exit ;
  | call string_literal ;
  | exit string_literal ;
  | Exp ++ ;
  | Exp -- ;
  | set-timeout Exp;
```

```
Exp:
  Exp ([+/-*<>])|GT|NE|GE|LE|LT|EQ|>=|<=|!=|==|&&|'||'|and|or Exp
  | Identifier
  | hexLiteral
  | string_literal
  | intLiteral
  | byte_array
  | [+=] Exp
  | ( Exp )

VariableAssignment;
  Identifier = Exp ;
  | Identifier [ Exp ] = Exp ;
  | Identifier . length = Exp ;

```


## Data Types
There are 3 data types supported:
`Integer:` An integer number

`String:` Any sort of string of characters enclosed by `''` or `""`

`ByteArray:` A series of bytes separated by the `|` symbol. 
  - Example: `bytes = 00|42|69|A4;`
  - Bytes are represented as Hex literals without the `0x` prefix
  - The following are examples of invalid byte arrays:
    - `0x00|0xFF|0`
    - `100|3000|0`
   

Integers can be used as a form of implicit boolean type, so the following is correct and would function. The convention for boolean evaluation is the same as C/C++ style boolean evaluation based on ints

```
if (1)
{
  perrintln "Wow I'm so cool.";
}
else
{
  perrintln "Wow I wish I were cool. :(";
}

```



## Language Specifications

- logical lines are delimited by semicolons (due to windows using cr-lf)
- Spacing is ignored
- `//` or `#` style comments are allowed
- tests / routines cannot have the same names
- variables can be declared in a global or local scope
- There are only 2 scopes: global and routine/test level
- file extensions will be .pers (purdue electric racing script)
- a syntax checker will check syntax prior to execution 
- variable types need not be declared (i.e. no string, int, float, etc)
- scripts are case sensitive, with commands being lowercase and constants, e.g.  `(HIGH|LOW|DIN|DOUT|AIN|AOUT)` being uppercase
- variables are accessed by simply referencing the variable name e.g. `print varname;`
- The parser is a single pass parser, meaning that all routine declarations must be made prior to the one calling it, similar to C/C++
    - with this, the interpreter does not allow forward declarations / prototyping. It is not intended to be a full featured programming language, and as such having overly complex and interdependent code is discouraged
- tests are not callable from other tests / routines, but routines can be callable from other tests and routines
- string literals can be either "" or ''
- values which come in the form of a buffer (aka an array) will be converted to strings to be stored in the global response object
  - this is for ease of comparisons
- global variables must be declared at the top of the file
- routines must be declared after global var decls, and before test decls
- CAN message objects have [] and .length operators
  - [] is used to access bytes at the specified index
  - .length is used to specify the DLC for a CAN frame
    - by default this will be assumed to be the number of bytes in the initial declaration
- The keyword `ELAPSED_MS` can be accessed like a variable to get the current elapsed time (approx.) in milliseconds.
  - This is not a variable, and is not writable. If you try to write to it, nothing will happen. 
- a maximum execution time for a test / routine can be specified using the `set-timeout` function.

## Explanation of inbuilt functions

  - Routines are equivalent to a test, but have a different name for clarity
  - Routines are meant for performing non-testing operations (i.e. make no calls to EXPECT or ASSERT)
  - They are intended as a setup functionality, such as in the case of simulating part of the car but there is no terminus
  - Routines will NOT be executed by running the interpreter from the command line without explicitly passing the argument to do so





`send-msg`
  - can take up to 8 numbers, which equate to bytes, delimited by '|'
  - The data argument can be a variable, and the address can also be a variable
  - If the array being passed to the function has a length > 8 bytes, then send-msg will send only the first 8 bybtes


`read-msg `     
  - Will read from the CAN bus for 1.5 seconds before timing out if a message from the specified address does not arrive in that time frame
  - The information returned by this will be stored in a global static variable


`expect` <value> (LT | GT | GE | LE | NE | EQ) ([0-9]+ | Byte Array | identifier) 
       ( and <value> (LT | GT | GE | LE | NE | EQ) ([0-9]+ | Byte Array | identifier))* 
       ( or <value> (LT | GT | GE | LE | NE | EQ) ([0-9]+ | Byte Array | identifier) )*

  - continue execution even if expectation is not met
  - Verbose printing is hard, so you will only know what line number the expectation failed on for now

`assert`  same syntax as expect
  - die if expectation not met 
  - only terminates the running operation i.e. the currently executing test. Will not terminate the interpreter or any subsequent tests

`exit` 
  - pretty much just for debugging
  - will halt routine/test execution immediately

`prompt` 
  - this will print a message and block execution until the user continues

`call` 
  - this will only be useable to call routines

`serial-tx` 
  - writes the value specified to the global serial device location
  - can be of any variable for (byte-array, string, literal int, etc)

`serial-rx`
  - reads from the global serial device and stores the response in the static
    response variable. Additionally will log to stdout / file output if -v switch is specified
  
`set-timeout`
  - specifies that the current execution should not run for more than the specified milliseconds. Will fail the test if the timeout is reached.


- RETVAL will be a reserved keyword for the global static result variable


- It is not advised to make a routine call in the middle of test execution if the RETVAL is required for later usage, as this may cause overwriting of the value
- PERScript is spacing inconsiderate, meaning spacing is unimportant, so long as tokens are distinguishable 

 
PERterpreter commands
=====================
  `perterpret <scriptname.pers> [(-V, --validate} | (-T, --run-tests testlist) | (-R, --run-routines routinelist)]| <-g dest> [-dev device] [-io device] [-v] [-l logfile]`
  - `-dev`: generic serial device which serial-rx and serial-tx will send / receive from
  - `-io`: the device to be used as the IO platform (e.g. COM3, /dev/tty4, etc)
  - `-v --verbose`: enables verbose printing. If enabled, all script commands
                supporting verbose printing will print to stdout
  - `-t, --test-output filename`: filename of where to put the test output
  - `-g, --generate-sample dest`: generate a sample script and put in in the supplied path. Users can specify the file name by specifying a whole (existing) path and appending the file's name to the path
  - `-V, --validate`: if this switch is passed, the interpreter will not execute. It will instead only perform syntax parsing and type checking. This is useful for checking scripts before actually running them if you don't want to run them.
  - `-T, --run-tests <test list ...>`: this is a list of tests to run if you don't want to run all of them
  - `-R, --run-routines`: This is a list of routines to run if you want to run any of them. Default behavior is to not run any.
    - For -R and -T, the order specified will be the order scripts are run in
  - `-b --baud`: the baud rate to use for the CAN device (only makes an impact on windows. If on Linux, use the `setup_can.sh` script). Defaults to 500kB
  - `--no-gpio`: Passing this switch will disable the requirement for selecting a serial GPIO device. Only use this if your script makes no calls to pin read or write functions. If one of these functions is called with this switch passed, an exception will be thrown and the program will terminate.
  - `--no-can`: Passing this switch will disable the requirement for having a CAN device attached. Only use this if your script makes no calls to send-msg or read-msg. If one of these functions is called with this switch passed, an exception will be thrown and the program will terminate.


- Any devices which are communicating with the basic serial-tx/rx commands will need to send \r\n at the end of their message strings

  set-pin DOUT 3 HIGH;
  delay 45;
  read-pin DIN 4;  // read-x would store return result in some static variable, 
                  // which would then be accessible forever by EXPECT and ASSERT

  VAR = RETVAL;    // RESULT will be a reserved keyword for the global static result variable

  expect RETVAL GT 6;  // 
  prompt "Yo momma so fat that the tide comes in when she goes to the beach";

  loop 4 {
    perrint "OHHHHHH YOU JUST GOT REKT SON";
  }

### Building on Windows
1. Install Qt Creator open source (Make sure to install Qt 5.15, not Qt 6. This code is untested on Qt 6 since it was only release a few months prior to the rollout of this system.)
2. Add `C:\Qt\Tools\mingw810_64\bin` to your path
3. Add `C:\Qt\5.15.2\mingw81_64\bin` to your path
4. Open the project in QtCreator and click on the hammer button to build it.
5. Once the project has been built, open a command prompt and cd into the `build` directory. 
6. run `windeployqt .\perterpreter.exe` to copy the necessary .dlls into the build directory so that it can be run.

### On Linux
1. Make sure you have the most recent version of QT5 installed.
2. Clone the repo and init all submodules.
3. `cd` into the repo's directory
4. run `qmake` to generate the Makefile
5. run `make`
6. The executable should be now located in `<path to repo>/build/perterpreter`
7. Prosper.
Future developments
===
* Add the ability to actually print out the expectation for an expect/assert call instead of just the call failing
